# **Building Segmentation with Segment Anything Model (SAM)**

**An innovative geospatial project leveraging Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to identify and segment buildings in satellite images.**  
This project combines advanced zero-shot segmentation with geospatial tools for precise and interactive analysis.

---

## üöÄ **Overview**

This project applies **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** to segment buildings in high-resolution satellite imagery. By integrating **Leafmap** and **Rasters**, it enables:
- Automated building identification.
- Customizable bounding box selection.
- Interactive map visualization of segmentation results.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban development analysis.
- Disaster recovery planning.
- Environmental monitoring.

## ‚ú® **Features**

- **Zero-shot Segmentation**: No need for task-specific training.
- **Customizable ROIs**: Define regions of interest interactively or use default bounding boxes.
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize segmentation on geospatial maps.
- **Exportable Results**: Save masks for downstream applications.
